⚠️ Findings Explained

Server: nginx/1.19.0
→ Shows what web server is used. Attackers can use this info to look for known exploits.

X-Powered-By: PHP/5.6.40
→ Server reveals the PHP version. PHP 5.6 is outdated and no longer supported, which makes it vulnerable.

Missing X-Frame-Options header
→ The website can be embedded in another page using an <iframe>, allowing clickjacking attacks.

Missing X-Content-Type-Options header
→ Browser can guess content types, increasing the risk of executing malicious files.

/clientaccesspolicy.xml allows all domains
→ This file permits any external domain to interact with the site (unsafe cross-domain access).

/crossdomain.xml allows all domains
→ Same issue — allows unrestricted cross-domain access, which can expose sensitive data.

/index.php: Possible MySQL connection string found
→ Nikto detected something that looks like database credentials inside the file — this is dangerous if real credentials are exposed.

Error limit reached (20 errors)
→ Nikto faced repeated HTTP errors (like timeouts or server rejections) and stopped early. Some parts of the site weren’t fully scanned.

✅ Summary in Plain Words

The website is running old PHP, missing important security headers, and has risky policy files that allow anyone to access data. There’s also a possible leak of database credentials inside the main page.

These aren’t active hacks but configuration weaknesses that make the site easier to attack.
